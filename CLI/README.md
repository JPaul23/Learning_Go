## Building CLI Applications

Command line interfaces (CLIs), unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are text-only. Cloud and infrastructure applications are primarily CLI-based due to their easy automation and remote capabilities.

### Cobra

Cobra is a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications, which was used to build dadJoke CLI.
Built by following tutorial from [Div Rhino](https://dev.to/divrhino). I found these tutorial understandable, easy to follow and on point.
